# Installing Lens

## Fresh install

1. Install the Substance Screwdriver command line utility

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/substance/screwdriver.git
   $ cd screwdriver
   $ sudo python setup.py install
   ```


2. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/elifesciences/lens.git
   ```
  
3. Run the update command, which pulls in all the dependencies

   ```bash
   $ cd lens
   $ substance --update
   ```
  
4. Finally start the server and point your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

   ```bash
   $ substance
   ```
   

You can have a look at the example document, by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:4000/#lorem_ipsum` or view the autogenerated Lens.Article documentation `http://localhost:4000/#lens_article
   
   
## Keep your version in sync

You may want to pull in updates every now and then, which is simple. In the lens project root dir do:

   ```bash
   $ substance --update
   ```


## Contributing

I'm assuming here that you have push access to the repositories, because as a start I'd like to get the Lens core dev team get up and running. I'll provide documentation on how to work with a forked version of a module and submit a pull request soon.


Say you've made changes to the Lens.Artcile module. In order to commit them you simple have to navigate to `node_modules/lens-article` and do:

   ```bash
   $ git add <YOUR STUFF>
   $ git commit -m "Fixed X"
   $ git push
   ```
   
Alternatively, if you working on breaking changes you can switch to a different branch, and submit a pull request using the Github interace. Here's how

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my_feature_branch
   $ git add <YOUR STUFF>
   $ git commit -m "Fixed X"
   $ git push
   ```
